Moory Popins
===========

Moory Popins is a nifty widget, written in MooTools framework, that allows you to show popin (modal) windows within a
web page. Browsers that doesn't support CSS Transitions will utilize Javascript fading instead. Settings currently allow
you to show the information in an Iframe or if you want the popin in a fixed position (follows the user when scrolling)

How to use
-----------------

Javascript snippet to initialize the class:

	window.addEvent("domready", function() {
		var MP = new MooryPopins({
            src: "MooryPopins.html",
            iframe: true,
            fixed: true
        });
	});


CSS selector to style the overlay and its children, eg:

	ARTICLE#overlay-popin {}

Options
-----------------
    iframe: (boolean) Show the response in an IFRAME or a DIV? | default: false (a DIV)
    fixed: (boolean) Does the popin have a fixed position? If yes, it will follow the user when scrolling | default: false
    src: (string) Path to the resource you want to display | default: "about:blank"
    duration: (integer) How long should the transitions take? In milliseconds. | default: 250
    css: (object) Some default CSS class-/id-names that are used. Change these if they're conflicting with your webpage


Methods
-----------------

The following methods are availible publicly:

    populate: takes string and fetches resource to display in the popin
